General IO stream manipulation utilities.

This class provides static utility methods for input/output operations.
    [Deprecated] closeQuietly - these methods close a stream ignoring nulls and exceptions
    toXxx/read - these methods read data from a stream
    write - these methods write data to a stream
    copy - these methods copy all the data from one stream to another
    contentEquals - these methods compare the content of two streams

The byte-to-char methods and char-to-byte methods involve a conversion step. Two methods are provided in each case, one that uses the platform default encoding and the other which allows you to specify an encoding. You are encouraged to always specify an encoding because relying on the platform default can lead to unexpected results, for example when moving from development to production.

All the methods in this class that read a stream are buffered internally. This means that there is no cause to use a BufferedInputStream or BufferedReader. The default buffer size of 4K has been shown to be efficient in tests.
